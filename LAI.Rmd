## Course Overview

Welcome to Land-Atmosphere Interactions - ENSC 480. The terrestrial biosphere currently absorbs about one-third of anthropogenic CO$_2$ emissions, playing a crucial role in mitigating climate change. However, the future of this carbon sink is uncertain as the planet continues to warm. Understanding the processes that regulate land-atmosphere carbon fluxes is therefore essential for predicting how the carbon cycle will evolve. This challenge demands an interdisciplinary approach that examines processes across different spatial scales, from the molecular level to the canopy. The goal of this course is to cultivate an interdisciplinary understanding of land-atmosphere interactions. Lectures are complemented by tutorials featuring simple programming exercises designed to help you develop basic programming skills necessary for studying the carbon cycle and conducting research. For more information, please access the [syllabus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NzeqicEvHJjf2FSJxFfqovFu6Yx-k1PT/view?usp=sharing), explore the tutorials, and have a look at the slides that can be downloaded from the links in the table below. I will update the slides and tutorials as we progress, and you can expect the material to be finalized on the day of each class.

### Schedule and Slides (Fall Term 2024)
The course lasts from Sep 3 to Dec 3, 2024 (Tue 2:30PM - 5:30PM). Please prepare each lecture by reading the corresponding chapter in your textbook.
